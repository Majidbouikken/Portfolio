        iShop is an online shopping platform fully built with Flutter.
        it's a classic e-commerce app created for the Algerian market, it aims to show nearby products and deals to users.
        The application counts heavily on its fluid and intuitive UX rather than offering smarter solutions, it is also built on a fully custom UI design, supports multiple locals, and is very scalable and maintainable due to its very organized and structured codebase.`,
