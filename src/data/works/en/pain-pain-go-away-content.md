## How do we make painful medical procedures easier for kids?
By engaging a patient into a VR game that is immersive enough to switch his attention from the medical procedure. 

The game doesn't require using hands or any controllers apart from a VR headset: it tracks movements of player's eyes/head, which makes the medical procedure easier and safer, at the same time keeping the player engaged in the game and well distracted.

Additionally the game does tracking of the player's "distraction" by checking his level of involvement into the game/the score. This gives doctors insights of how stressed the patient is.

## So what is this game about?
It is a simple space shooter game, where the player controls a flying spaceship using his head movements. The spaceship shoots rocks with a (blink of an eye?), and the amount of the asteroids shot is reflected in the game score.

## Main points
 - Engage kid into gaming, distract from what is going with him/her IRL.
 - Provide simple feedback to the doctor on when's the best time to do the procedure, metrics on how distracted the kid is.
 - Long-term monitoring of in-game performance may give additional hints on kids well being. 
 - Live monitoring gives insights on the current kid's distress level or might be used for, say, brain neurological surgeries.
